PERN Photo App - https://intense-river-80365.herokuapp.com/

A basic Photo Application which allows you to categorise and add links to photos from the web through adding their URL - those Photos can then be favorited or removed. 

The Photo Viewer App used a React front-end, with an Express back-end connected to a Postgres database. 

**Front-end:**
- React Hooks (useEffect, useState, useRef, custom built hooks)
- React Context
- React Router
- Axios

**Back-end:**
- Express standard components
- Node Postgres
- Cors
- Donenv

## [Deno Photo App](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
The same App using a Deno back-end instead of Express.
